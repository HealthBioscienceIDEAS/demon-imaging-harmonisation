    "This notebook will give a brief example of how to correct, or harmonize for site-related differences in image biomarkers. This problem is cropping up more and more often as we need multi-site data to have large enough sample sizes for many research applications, particularly for those that are based on machine learning and need a large enough training set to produce an accurate model. For more background on this, please see the [accompanying documenation](https://healthbioscienceideas.github.io/demon-imaging-harmonisation/). \n"

    "## ComBat approach for batch adjustment\n",
    "A more recent, advanced approach to handle multi-site data is the ComBat method, originally proposed for genomic analysis and now applied quite often to imaging analyses. ComBat has a lot of advantages, as it was designed to help both with the additive bias **AND** the multiplicative bias (heteroskedasticity). In addition, it has far better suited to handle uneven data between sitesa dn samll sample sizes for those sites. So let's take a look at This is really helpful, but what if there are difference in standard error between sites, and how can we trust those small sample size in some cells. ComBat provides \"harmonised\" values out of the analyses that have accounted for the batch variable (here site) so that you can perform your analysis on them. There are many implementations of ComBat around for R and for Python. I am using [neuroCombat](https://github.com/Jfortin1/neuroCombat) for Python, but there is also other implementations/extensions, such as [neuroHarmonize](https://github.com/rpomponio/neuroHarmonize).\n",
