# Why harmonisation is needed 
Magnetic resonant imaging (MRI) is the standard gold technique for studying the brain's white matter (WM) organization and tissue characteristics. As with many other imaging modalities, MRI images suffer from technical between-scanner variation that hinders comparisons across imaging sites and scanners over time. 

As the number of publicly available neuroimaging databases increases over time, a crucial goal is to combine large-scale imaging studies and improve the statistical analyses to test common biological hypotheses. It is essential to include images of the same subjects from various acquisition sites to meet this goal. 

The main reasons why we need images from multiple acquisition sites from the neuroimaging databases are the following: 
*	We are looking for small but meaningful effect sizes within the image. We can achieve it by reducing the size of the image to include only the region of interest. The benefit is to accommodate in our studies a more extensive sample number AND minimize variability.
*	We need to recruit patients to participate in studies and trials, and this is increasingly competitive, so publicly available multi-site data are convenient to use and cost-effective.
*	With multi-site data, we achieve more representative sampling of the population.
