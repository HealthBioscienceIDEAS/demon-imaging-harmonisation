## 1st part : Differences in image acquisition
This part of the lecture shows why images are different. Even the scans of the same individual show differences in physiological noise, instrument noise, differences in hardware and software. The gold standard of identifying these differences is often a “travelling head” study, where a small handful of individuals are scanned at multiple sites. The first part of the demo demonstrated at the notebook index.ipynb, is to look at two scans from the same individual on a different scanner. We register the data of the two sites longitudinally  and then show shape/intensity/geometric differences—potential data sources: GENFI examples.

## 2nd part : Harmonisation 
Here we pply harmonisation COMBAT technique to combine multi-site datasets of multiple individuals at different scanners and demonstrate the advantage of COMBAT.
Then we perform a linear regression using the acquicition site as a covariate.
